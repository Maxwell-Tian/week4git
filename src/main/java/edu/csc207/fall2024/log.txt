    commit message: task 3 and 1 completed
    log: Fuck UofT, I thought this shit was work for the team and I spent all my time on other courses, I just found out
    today that this shit is a fucking individual work. Fuck this world, I spent half of my study time on PDE and that
    bitch(PDE) cheated on me, It's not giving anything back and I feel like a simp of it. I have no fucking idea about
    PDE even though I was working on it EVERY SINGLE FUCKING DAY. Fuck my life, fuck PDE, fuck physics and this shitty
    university. Imma gonna jump off from the rooftop someday.
